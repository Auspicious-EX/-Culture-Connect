## Understanding Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without proper acknowledgment. In the context of coding, plagiarism occurs when one copies code from another source without giving credit or proper attribution. This can include copying entire code blocks, snippets, or algorithms, as well as using ideas or concepts without acknowledgment.

### Why Plagiarism is Harmful
Plagiarism undermines the principles of academic and professional integrity. It devalues the original author's work and creativity, erodes trust within the community, and can have serious consequences for individuals and organizations. Additionally, plagiarized code may introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, or legal issues if used without proper understanding or authorization.
